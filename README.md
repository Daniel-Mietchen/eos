Open Science and Open Research have become buzzwords, yet the underlying practice of actually sharing the *research process* rather than &mdash; or in addition to &mdash; an abbreviated narrative thereof (e.g. the typical research article) is not widely practiced yet. This mismatch is often explained by a lack of incentives for the different actors within the research ecosystem to share anything other than these narratives.

In this repo, I am planning to collect some information about

1. how the different stakeholders can encourage open science in general or specific aspects thereof
1. what kinds of encouragement are most likely to engage said stakeholders in the activities outlined above.

In short, I am aiming at **encouragement by** and **encouragement for** the different stakeholders, and of course some way of linking between the two in a manner that moves the system closer towards open science in practice.
