This file collects information about the range of stakeholders involved in the research process as well as *things they can do* or *things they are encouraged by* with respect to moving towards open science. Special emphasis will be placed on things that can be done in the short term to address some long-term issues. The listing is not meant to be comprehensive, nor is there any implication that the given groups of stakeholders do not overlap. I will post related threads at [Open Science Q & A (OSQA)](https://openscience.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/) under the [stakeholders](https://openscience.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/tag/stakeholders) tag and will link to them below.
